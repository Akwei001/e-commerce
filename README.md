## Background

I built the application because I wanted to learn more about  about NextJS, CMS, and payment APIs like Stripe. I had never used a CMS before or tried to fetch data using NextJS. For Sanity CMS, they created the schema and fetched data using getServerSideProps. I also used the Stripe API to create a payment basket.
